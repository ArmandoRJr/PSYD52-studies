# PSYD52-studies
General studies, code and other shenanigans from going through PSYD52 @ UTSC.

## What is this?
Like it says in the description, this is my public logbook as I read and self-study PSYD52 - Neural Network Models of Cognition Laboratory.
The course is not actually available at the University of Toronto Scarborough anymore, but [the syllabus](https://hive.utsc.utoronto.ca/public/psych/syllabi/20209/20209-PSYD52-Cree.pdf) and provided materials seem robust enough to attempt to build my own neural network project by the end of Summer 2023.
