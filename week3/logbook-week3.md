## Personal Thoughts
Massive break between this week and the last - too much on my plate recently but we back.
Got some news from Cree about the course.
Mans really said the book is outdated 
or rather, that there's probably better ones to learn from.

And you know what? He's probably very right
We're not using any of the modern Python libraries in this course, and progress has advanced a ton these last few years. However, I still think there's some merit to trying to follow this - it creates a decent enough understanding of the basics.
I will keep following this, because why not.

I will say though, I'm probably just reading the book from now on.
There's just too much of a discrepancy between the book and the videos.
The vids are good for understanding the concepts just a little bit more clearly, 
but they're really behind on code.
