## Personal Thoughts
This course seems...very difficult to attempt for someone who might have not have strong knowledge in algebra. I know my high school definitely didn't have enough algebra to handle this, and I would have definitely required something like MATA22 to even understand the lectures for this. 

The 3B1B video goes straight into matrices and vectors (which is simple enough but if you've never heard of "dot product" in your life, this seems Not Great™️ to start with). 

Maybe that's why the course doesn't exist anymore, I don't know if it'd be reasonable to expect Psych students to have taken MATA22, at least some programming course (mainly CSCA08) and possibly MATA31/A37.

Still, let's see how far we can go with this. It seems fun. It's all math, but knowing what a neuron does (from places like PSYB55) when transmitting information helps a lot. Basic concepts like the neurons, axons, action potentials, synaptic clefts (and probably what neurotransmitters do and why they work/sometimes don't) will most likely come in handy.
